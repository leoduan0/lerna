# About

\*\***As of May 2024, all notes here were transferred from the old version of Lerna, so they do not serve as adequate learning resources but better suited as study or review guides. I am currently working on improved versions that deliver on what's promised.**\*\*

This is a collection of notes. They were written with the intention that one would be able to fully understand a technical concept or idea just by reading these notes without any outside references.

I'm always open to suggestions and errata of any form. If you wish to point anything out, please email me.

## Pillars

- Lerna is objective.
- Lerna is ultimate (I am working on making this a reality); one should be able to fully understand a concept from materials provided solely by Lerna.
- Lerna is by everyone, for everyone (I am also working on making this a reality).

## Ads

I don't like ads, and you probably don't either, but I still run them here. If you use an ad blocker, that's totally fine. However, the revenue of these ads go to [Orphan's Hope](https://orphanshope.org), a nonprofit organization that is doing a great work caring for orphans in Myanmar, Ukraine, and Pakistan.
