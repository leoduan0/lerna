Lerna is a collection of notes. It was written so that anyone could fully understand a technical concept or idea just by reading these notes without any outside references.

You can use it for competition preparation (the sciences) or school.

I am always open to ideas, suggestions, and errata. If you wish to point anything out, please visit the [Lerna issues GitHub repository](https://github.com/leoduan0/lerna-issues/issues).

## Ads

I wouldn't say I like ads, and you probably wouldn't either, but I still run them here. If you use an ad blocker, that's fine! However, the revenue from these ads goes to [Orphan's Hope](https://orphanshope.org), a nonprofit organization that is doing great work caring for orphans in Myanmar, Ukraine, and Pakistan.
