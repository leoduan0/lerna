Lerna is a collection of learning resources. It was written to counter scrappy free online resources and paywalls behind good resources.

The notes were written quite concisely and the student is expected to derive certain formulas and theorems themselves. Additionally, you can use this site for competition preparation.

I am always open to ideas, suggestions, and errata. If you wish to point anything out, please visit the [Lerna issues GitHub repository](https://github.com/leoduan0/lerna-issues/issues).

## Ads

I wouldn't say I like ads, and you probably wouldn't either, but I still run them here. If you use an ad blocker, that's fine! However, the revenue from these ads goes to [Orphan's Hope](https://orphanshope.org), a nonprofit organization that is doing great work caring for orphans in Myanmar, Ukraine, and Pakistan.
