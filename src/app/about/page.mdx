This is a collection of learning resources. They were written with the intention that one would be able to fully understand a technical concept or idea just by reading these notes without any outside references.

I am always open to all kinds of ideas, suggestions, and errata. If you wish to point anything out, please visit the [Lerna issues GitHub repository](https://github.com/leoduan0/lerna-issues/issues).

## Pillars

- Lerna is objective.
- Lerna is a one-time stop (I am working on making this a reality); one should be able to fully understand a concept from materials provided solely by Lerna.
- Lerna is by everyone, for everyone (I am also working on making this a reality).

## Ads

I don't like ads, and you probably don't either, but I still run them here. If you use an ad blocker, that's totally fine. However, the revenue of these ads go to [Orphan's Hope](https://orphanshope.org), a nonprofit organization that is doing a great work caring for orphans in Myanmar, Ukraine, and Pakistan.
