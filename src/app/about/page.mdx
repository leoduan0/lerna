# About

\*\***As of May 2024, all notes here were transferred from the old version of Lerna, so they do not serve as adequate learning resources but better suited as study or review guides. I am currently working on improved versions that deliver on what's promised.**\*\*

This is a collection of notes. They were written with the intention that one would be able to fully understand a technical concept or idea just by reading these notes without any outside references.

I'm always open to suggestions and errata of any form. If you wish to point anything out, please email me.
