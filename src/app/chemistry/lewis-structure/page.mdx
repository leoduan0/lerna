# Lewis Structure

**Lewis structures** are diagrams that show the bonding and other relevant information (such as valence electrons and the types of bonds involved).

<Rule

      <p>
        Given a chemical formula, to form a Lewis structure, follow the
        following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Count the number of valence electrons.</li>
        <li>
          Charges of the compound, if any, will be added to the number of
          valence electrons. If the charge is negative, add the number of
          negative charges to the number of valence electrons. If the charge is
          positive, subtract the number of positive charges to the number of
          valence electrons.
