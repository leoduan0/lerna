# Oxidation and Reduction

- **Oxidation** is the loss of electrons of an atom. _e.g._ $$ Ba \to Ba^{2+} + 2e^- $$
- **Reduction** is the gain of electrons of an atom. _e.g._ $$ Mn^{2+} +2e^- \to Mn $$

## Redox Reactions

**Redox reactions** are chemical reactions which involve the oxidation and/or the reduction of elements within the reaction.

### Half Reactions

In an acidic solution, to balance out half reactions, follow the following steps:

1. Balance all reactions except for the hydrogens and the oxygens.
2. Add the least number of $$ H_2O $$ required to either or both sides until the total number of oxygen atoms on each side are equal.
3. Add the least number of $$ H^+ $$ required to either or both sides until the total number of hydrogen atoms on each side are equal.
4. Add as many $$ e^- $$ as needed to either side of the equation to make the total charge on both sides equal.
5. Multiply either or both equations by the smallest integer coefficient so that the amount of electrons on both sides is the same.
6. Add both equations together.
7. Simplify.

In a basic solution, follow the exact steps as the acidic reaction, and then carry out the following steps:

1. Add as many $$ OH^- $$ as there are $$ H^+ $$ to **both** side of the equation.
2. On the side where the $$ H^+ $$ was originally present, merge the $$ H^+ $$ with the $$ OH^- $$ to water.
3. Simplify.
