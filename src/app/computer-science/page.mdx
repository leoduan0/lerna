# Computer Science

**Computer science** is the study (of aspects) of computing.

Computer science is closely related to computers, including the software side and also the hardware side. Its applications are broad; specifically, the discipline applies to all computing devices - not just computers.

Here, we will start by delving into the basics of programming languages by learning about general concepts such as conditionals, data storing, classes, and more. Then, we will learn about how real programmers use programming languages to build software (such as using TypeScript to build a React application).
