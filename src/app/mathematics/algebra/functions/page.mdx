# Functions

A **function** $$ f(x) = y $$ associates certain values of $$ x $$ with a certain value of $$ y $$, where $$ x $$ is called the **input** of the function and $$ y $$ is called the **output** of the function.

For a single input, there can only be one output.

For a single output, there can be more than or equal to one input.

<Block text="Example">
Given $$ f(x) = x^2 $$, find $$ f(-1) $$.

To find $$ f(-1) $$, realize that  $$ -1 $$ is simply taken as the input for the function and thus substituting all $$ x $$ with $$ -1 $$ and evaluating would result in the answer.

$$ \because f(x) = (-1)^2 = 1 $$
$$ \therefore f(-1) = 1 $$

</Block>

<Block text="Example">
Given $$ f(x) = (x+1)^{2} $$, find $$ f(x-2) $$.

Notice that, to solve this problem, we would have to substitute $$ x-2 $$ for every $$ x $$ inside $$ f(x) = {x+1}^{2} $$, thus:

$$ \because f(x) = (x+1)^2 $$
$$ \therefore f(x-2) = (x-1)^2 $$

## Domain

The **domain** of a function $$ f(x) $$ is the set of all inputs such that when passed into $$ f(x) $$ yields a defined value.

<Block text="Example">
The domain of $$ f(x) = x^3+2 $$ is $$ \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \} $$ (the set of all real numbers) since for all real values as input there exist a defined value for its corresponding output.
</Block>

<Block text="Example">
The domain of $$ f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{2-x}}{x} $$ is $$ \{ x \in \R \mid x < 0 \text{ or } 0 < x \leq 2 \} $$ since taking any number outside of its domain as input to $$ f(x) $$ would either yield a non-real output or is undefined.
</Block>

## Range

The **range** of a function $$ f(x) $$ is the set of all possible outputs that $$ f(x) $$ could yield.

<Block text="Example">
The range of $$ f(x) = {x}^{3}+2 $$ is $$ \{ y \in \R \} $$ since $$ f(x) $$ could output any real value.
</Block>

<Block text="Example">
  The range of $$ f(x) = {x}^{2}+1 $$ is $$ (1, \infty ) $$ since $$ f(x) $$
  could only output values more than or equal to 1.
</Block>

In range notation:

- "$$ [ $$" or "$$ ] $$" means inclusive.
- "$$ ( $$" and "$$ ) $$" means exclusive.
- $$ \infty $$ and $$ -\infty $$ are always exclusive.

## Arithmetic

### Addition and Subtraction

$$ f(x) \pm g(x) $$ is valid if the domains of $$ f(x) $$ and $$ g(x) $$ are the same.

### Multiplication

$$ f(x) \times g(x) $$ is always valid.

### Division

$$ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} $$ is always valid (it remains true that having 0 as the denominator is undefined).

## Composition

**Composition** is combining two functions to make one function by taking one function as the input of the other.

<Block text="Example">
  Suppose $$ f(x) = x^2 $$ and $$ g(x) = 2x-1 $$, then:
  <ul>
    <li>$$ f(g(x)) = (2x-1)^2 $$</li>
    <li>$$ g(f(x)) = 2 x^2 - 1 $$</li>
  </ul>
</Block>

$$ f(g(x)) $$ and $$ g(f(x)) $$ are called **composite functions**.

## Odd Functions and Even Functions

A function $$ f(x) $$ is **odd** if $$ f(-x) = -f(x) $$.

All odd functions are symmetric about the origin.

A function $$ f(x) $$ is **even** if $$ f(-x) = f(x) $$.

All even functions are symmetric about the y-axis.

Some functions may be neither odd or even.

## Inverse Functions

The inverse of some function $$ f(x) $$, denoted by $$ f^{-1}(x) $$, exists iff $$ f(x) $$ is a one-to-one function (injective).

The inverse of a function can be found by:

| Procedure                              | Annotation                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $$ f(x) = 2 x^2 + 3 $$                 | Original function.              |
| $$ x = 2 y^2 + 3 $$                    | Swap the input with the output. |
| $$ f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{x-3}{2}} $$ | Isolate the input.              |

The domain of $$ f(x) $$ is the range of $$ f^{-1}(x) $$.

The range of $$ f(x) $$ is the domain of $$ f^{-1}(x) $$.

## Zero(es)

The **zero(es)** of some function $$ f(x) $$ is the value(s) of $$ x $$ such that $$ f(x) = 0 $$.
