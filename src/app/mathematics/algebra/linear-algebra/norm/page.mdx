# Norm

The **norm** of some n-dimensional mathematical entity returns the magnitude of that entity.

The norm of a scalar $$ x $$ is denoted by $$ |x| $$, defined as $$ \left| x \right| = \sqrt{x^2} $$. This is often referred to as the **absolute value**.

The norm of an n-dimensional vector $$ \vec{x} = \langle x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n \rangle $$ is denoted as $$ \lVert x \rVert $$, defined as $$ \lVert x \rVert = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} $$.

<Block text="Example">

If $$ \vec{a} = \langle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rangle $$, then $$ \lVert \vec{a} \rVert = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{55} $$.
