# Space

An $$ n $$-dimensional **space** is denoted by $$ \R^n $$.

## Dimensions

The number of **dimensions** in a space is:

- The number of coordinates that is needed to locate a point in that space
- The number of lines that can be drawn in that space while all the lines are perpendicular to all other lines.

<Block text="Example">

In $$ \R^2 $$, two coordinates are needed to specify where a point is. In $$ \R^3 $$, three coordinates are needed to specify where a point is. In $$ \R^0 $$, zero coordinates are needed to specify where a point is.
