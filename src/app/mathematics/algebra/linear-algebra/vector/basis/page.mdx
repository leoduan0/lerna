# Basis

In $$ \R^n $$, there are $$ n $$ <strong>standard basis vectors</strong> on each of the axes in the space. All standard basis vectors are unit vectors.

In $$ \R^2 $$, there are 2 standard basis vectors, denoted by $$ \vec{i} = \langle 1, 0 \rangle $$ and $$ \vec{j} = \langle 0, 1 \rangle $$.

In $$ \R^3 $$, there are 3 standard basis vectors, denoted by $$ \vec{i} = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle $$, $$ \vec{j} = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle $$, and $$ \vec{k} = \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle $$.

Standard basis vectors can be another way of denoting vectors.

$$ 4\vec{i} + 8\vec{j} + 9\vec{k} = \langle 4, 8, 9 \rangle $$
