# Factorial

A **factorial** of a number $$ x $$, denoted by $$ x! $$, is given by the following:

<Rule
  statement={
    <MathExpression
      math="(x-1)! = \Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1} e^{-t} \,dt"
      type="block"
    />
  }
  annotation={
    <p>
      This is also known as the <strong>gamma function</strong>.
    </p>
  }
/>

When $$ x $$ is an integer:

<Rule statement={<MathExpression math="x!=\prod_{i=1}^x n" type="block" />} />
