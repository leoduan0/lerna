# Algebra

**Algebra** is the study of algebraic structures, which consists of operations, and axioms.

**Operations** are entities which take in a certain number of values (the number of values which it takes in is called the **arity** of the operation) and outputs a value.

**Axioms** are statements assumed to be always true that do not require a proof. They serve as a premise for the algebraic structure that it is relevant to.

## Identities

- Reflexive identity : $$ a=a $$
- Symmetric identity: $$ a=b \implies b=a $$
- Transitive identity: $$ a=b \land b=c \implies a=c $$
- Additive identity: $$ a=b \implies a+c=b+c $$
- Multiplicative identity: $$ a=b \implies ac=bc $$
