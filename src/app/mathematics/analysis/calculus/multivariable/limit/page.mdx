# Limit

**Limit** in multivariable calculus is an extension to the concept of the limit in single variable calculus, but realize that to approach a specific point a $$ (a, b, c, ...) $$, we have to approach that point in every axis, and that there are an infinite amount of ways to approach any given point, as opposed to only two (the left-hand and the right-hand side) in single variable calculus.

The notation to approach point $$ (a, b) $$ on $$ f(x, y) $$ is as follows:

<Align type={'center'}>

$$ \lim_{(x, y) \to (a, b)} f(x, y) $$

</Align>

The notation to approach point $$ (a, b, c) $$ on $$ f(x, y, z) $$ is as follows:

<Align type={'center'}>

$$ \lim_{(x, y, z) \to (a, b, c)} f(x, y, z) $$

</Align>

And so on.

## Continuity

$$ f(x, y) $$ is **continuous** at $$ (a, b) $$ if $$ \lim\_{(x, y) \to (a, b)} f(x, y) = f(a, b) $$.
