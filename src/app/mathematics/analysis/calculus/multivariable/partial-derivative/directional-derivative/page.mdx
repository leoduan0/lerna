# Directional Derivative

**Directional derivatives** are derivatives found along a direction that is not parallel to an axis (like what we have done so far with partial derivatives). This direction would be defined by a unit vector $$ \vec{u} = \langle a, b \rangle $$ and the directional derivative of $$ f(x, y) $$ is:

<Align type="center">
  <Math math="D_{\vec{u}}f(x, y) = f_x(x, y)a + f_y(x, y)b" type="block" />
</Align>

And for $$ \vec{u} = \langle a, b, c \rangle $$ and $$ f(x, y, z) $$:

<Align type="center">
  <Math
    math='D_{\vec{u}}f(x, y, z) = f_x(x, y, z)a + f_y(x, y, z)b + f_z(x, y, z)c'
    
    type="block"
  />
</Align>

And so on.

Note that $$ D_{\vec{u}}f = \nabla f \cdot \vec{u} $$.
