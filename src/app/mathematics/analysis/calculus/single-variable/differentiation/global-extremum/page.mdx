# Global Extrema

Let $$ S $$ contain all values of $$ k $$ such that $$ f^{\\prime}(k) = 0 $$ on the interval $$ [a, b] $$, along with $$ a $$ and $$ b $$. On the interval $$ [a, b] $$:

- If the minimum value for $$ f(x) $$ for all numbers in $$ S $$ is $$ f(k) $$, then $$ k $$ is a global minimum.
- If the maximum value for $$ f(x) $$ for all numbers in $$ S $$ is $$ f(k) $$, then $$ k $$ is a global maximum.
