# Implicit Differentiation

For some equation in the form of $$ F(x, y)=0 $$, we say that it is an **implicit function** since the no variable in the equation is stated as a function of other terms.

<Block text={'Example'}>

Take a unit circle $$ x^2+y^2=1 $$, what is $$ \frac{dy}{dx} $$? The key is to find $$ \frac{dy}{dx}y^2 $$, which we can use the chain rule for:

$$ \frac{dy}{dx}y^2 = \frac{d(y^2)}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx} $$

$$ = 2y\frac{dy}{dx} $$

Thus $$ \frac{dy}{dx} $$ of $$ x^2+y^2=1 $$ is:

$$ 2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0 $$
