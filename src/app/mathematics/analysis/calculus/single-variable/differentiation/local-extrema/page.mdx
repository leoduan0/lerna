# Local Extrema

At any point where $$ f^{\prime}(k) = 0 $$ (critical points):

1. If $$ f^{\prime \prime}(k) > 0 $$, then $$ k $$ is a **local minimum**.
2. If $$ f^{\prime \prime}(k) < 0 $$, then $$ k $$ is a **local maximum**.
3. If $$ f^{\prime \prime}(k) = 0 $$ or is undefined, then:

- If $$ f^{\prime}(x) < 0 $$ just less than $$ k $$ while $$ f^{\prime}(x) > 0 $$ just greater than $$ k $$, then $$ k $$ is a local minimum.
- If $$ f^{\prime}(x) > 0 $$ just less than $$ k $$ while $$ f^{\prime}(x) < 0 $$ just greater than $$ k $$, then $$ k $$ is a local maximum.
- If the sign of $$ f^{\prime}(x) $$ just less than $$ k $$ and the sign of $$ f^{\prime}(x) $$ just greater than $$ k $$ is the same, then $$ k $$ is neither a local minimum nor maximum.
