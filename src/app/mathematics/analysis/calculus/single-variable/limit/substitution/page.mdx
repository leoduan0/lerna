# Substitution

Certain limits can be acquired by simply substituting the limit into the function as input.

<Block text="Example">
For example, for the function $$ f(x) = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 $$, what is $$ \lim_{x \to 4} f(x) $$?

First, the graph of $$ f(x) = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 $$ is shown here:

<Graph
  type="cartesian"
  viewBox={{
    x: [-5, 5],
    y: [-2, 10],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => (x/4)**2', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[
    { text: 'f(x) = \\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right)^2', position: [3, 3] },
  ]}
/>

It becomes immediately clear that both the left-hand limit and right-hand limit are both 1. We can use a table to prove this:

| x    | 3.9     | 3.99    | 3.999   | 4   | 4.001   | 4.01    | 4.1     |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| f(x) | 0.95063 | 0.99501 | 0.99950 | 1   | 1.00050 | 1.00501 | 1.05063 |

$$ f(x) = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 $$

$$ \because \lim_{x \to 4^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 4^+} f(x) = 1 $$

$$ \therefore \lim_{x \to 4} f(x) = 1 $$

Notice that the limit as x approaches 4 matches the corresponding value of $$ f(x) $$ with input of 4. This is one example of a function which the limit and the corresponding value matches. However, not all functions are like this. This is called **direct substitution**, where the limit can be acquired by directly substituting it into the function as input.
