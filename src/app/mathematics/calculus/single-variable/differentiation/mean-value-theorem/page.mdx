# Mean Value Theorem

The **mean value theorem** states that for a function $$ f(x) $$ that is continuous in the interval $$ [a, b] $$, then there exists at least one number, $$ c $$, where $$ f^{\prime}(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} $$. In other words, there is at least one point along $$ [a, b] $$ of $$ f(x) $$ where its derivative is equal to the average change of the function in the same interval.

## Rolle's Theorem

A special case of the mean value theorem is **Rolle's theorem**, which states that for a function $$ f(x) $$ that is continuous in the interval $$ [a, b] $$, for if $$ f(a)=f(b) $$, then there exists at least one number $$ c $$ in the interval $$ [a, b] $$ such that $$ f^{-1}(c)=0 $$.
