# Parts

**Integration by parts** states that, given an integral $$ \int u \,dv $$, it satisfies the following rule:

<Rule statement={<Math math="\int u \,dv = uv - \int v \,du" type="block" />} />

Thus, given a function $$ f(x) $$, one can integrate by splitting it into $$ u(x) $$ and $$ v(x) $$.

<Block text="Example">

To evaluate $$ \int x \sin(x) \,dx $$, let us set $$ u(x) = x $$ and $$ \,dv = \sin(x) \,dx $$. Then, according to the rule, $$ \int x \sin(x) \,dx = \int u \,dv = uv - \int v \,du = -x\cos(x) - \int -\cos(x) \,dx $$. Then, integrate, and we get that it equals to $$ \sin(x)-x\cos(x)+c $$.
