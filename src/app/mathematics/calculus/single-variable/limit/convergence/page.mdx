# Convergence

Certain limits at infinities (positive or negative) exist because while approaching the limit, the corresponding y value also approaches some definite value; they gradually get closer to a certain value, or they **converge**.

What is $$ \lim\_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x}+5 $$? The graph of $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x}+5 $$ is as follows:

<Graph
  type="cartesian"
  viewBox={{
    x: [-10, 10],
    y: [-5, 5],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => (1/x)+2', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[{ text: 'f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}+2', position: [3, 1] }]}
/>

First, we begin by figuring out what the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit is.

| $$ x $$    | $$ 0 $$     | $$ 1 $$ | $$ 10 $$  | $$ 100 $$  | $$ 1000 $$  | $$ 10000 $$  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| $$ f(x) $$ | (undefined) | $$ 6 $$ | $$ 5.1 $$ | $$ 5.01 $$ | $$ 5.001 $$ | $$ 5.0001 $$ |

Notice that the limit asks us to approach infinity, but the right-hand limit would be non-sensical in this case as approaching infinity from some value bigger than infinity is not apt. Thus, we can simply take the left-hand limit. When approaching infinity, we take increasingly big values for $$ x $$ and analyze their corresponding y values. It is apparent from the table above that as $$ x $$ approaches infinity, $$ y $$ approaches $$ 5 $$. Such phenomenons, that when the input value approaches infinity and its corresponding output value approaches some finite number, are called **convergence**. Thus:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x}+5 $$

$$ \because \lim\_{x \to \infty^-} f(x) = 5 $$

$$ \therefore \lim\_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 5 $$

Notice that for this particular function, its limit as it approaches $$ -\infty $$ can be found with a similar logic too, thus:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x}+5 $$

$$ \because \lim\_{x \to -\infty^+} f(x) = 5 $$

$$ \therefore \lim\_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = 5 $$

A limit would not exist if the left-hand and the right-hand limit is not equivalent. One possible reason for this is that the function **diverges**.
