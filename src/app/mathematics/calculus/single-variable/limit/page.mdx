# Limit

The value of a function $$ f(x) $$ when its input gets infinitely close to (but not at) a certain value $$ k $$ is called a **limit**, denoted as $$ \lim_{x \to k} f(x) $$, and that limit only exists if the left-hand limit $$ \lim_{x \to k^-} f(x) $$ (approaching $$ k $$ from the left) and the right-hand limit $$ \lim_{x \to k^+} f(x) $$ (approaching $$ k $$ from the right) also exists and equals the same value.

If $$ \lim_{x \to k} = \infty $$ or $$ \lim_{x \to k} = -\infty $$, the expression is still valid but the limit does not exist.

<Block text="Example">

If $$ f(x) = \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| $$, then what is $$ \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) $$? The value of $$ f(x) $$ is undefined when $$ x $$ is $$ 0 $$, but realize that limits is about getting infinitely close to a certain value and approximating the value at that point, not what the value is.

As we can see from the graph, as $$ x $$ approaches $$ 0 $$ from either the positive or negative side, the value of $$ y $$ increases rapidly. It would be useful to make a chart like the following to help us determine a limit:

<Graph
  type="cartesian"
  viewBox={{
    x: [-5, 5],
    y: [-2, 10],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => Math.abs(1/x)', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[{ text: 'f(x)=\\left|\\frac{1}{x}\\right|', position: [9, 9] }]}
/>

A left-hand limit $$ \lim_{x \to k^-} f(x) $$ implies approaching the value $$ k $$ from the negative (the left-hand) side. In the case, we can go from some arbitrary negative number, and then approach 0. Following the table of values above, we can start from $$ -1 $$, to $$ -0.1 $$, to $$ -0.01 $$, to $$ -0.001 $$. We can see that as $$ x $$ approaches $$ 0 $$ from the left-hand side, $$ y $$ approaches $$ \infty $$, thus $$ \lim_{x \to k^-} \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| = \infty $$.

A right-hand limit $$ \lim_{x \to k^+} f(x) $$ implies approaching the value $$ k $$ from the positive (the right-hand) side. In the case, we can go from some arbitrary positive number, and then approach $$ 0 $$. Following the table of values above, we can start from $$ 1 $$, to $$ 0.1 $$, to $$ 0.01 $$, to $$ 0.001 $$. We can see that as $$ x $$ approaches $$ 0 $$ from the right-hand side, $$ y $$ approaches $$ \infty $$, thus $$ \lim_{x \to k^+} \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| = \infty $$.

Since both the left-hand limit $$ \lim_{x \to k^-} f(x) $$ and the right-hand limit $$ \lim_{x \to k^+} f(x) $$ are equivalent to each other, we say that the limit $$ \lim_{x \to k} f(x) $$ exists and is equal to $$ \infty $$:

$$ f(x) = \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| $$

$$ f(x) = \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| $$

$$ \because \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = \infty $$

$$ \therefore \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \infty $$

Note that we are not saying the limit exists. $$ \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \infty $$ merely describes the behavior of this function.

It is also important to realize that the limit of a function at a given point is not the same as the value of the function for that given input (although in certain functions $$ \lim_{x \to k} f(x) = f(k) $$ would be true).

<Rule
  statement={<MathExpression math="\lim_{x \to k} f(x) \nRightarrow f(k)" type="block" />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: '\\lim_{x \\to k} f(x)',
      annotation: <MDX source="Limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $k$" />,
    },
    {
      term: 'f(k)',
      annotation: <MDX source="Value of $f(x)$ if $x=k$" />,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Continuity

$$ f(x) $$ is **continuous** at $$ a $$ if $$ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $$.
