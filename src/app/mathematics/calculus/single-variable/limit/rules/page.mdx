# Rules

## Constant Rule

$$ \lim\_{x \to c} k = k $$

## Constant Multiple Rule

$$ \lim*{x \to c} kf(x) = k\lim*{x \to c} f(x) $$

## Sum and Difference Rule

$$ \lim*{x \to c} f(x) \pm g(x) = \lim*{x \to c} f(x) \pm \lim\_{x \to c} g(x) $$

## Product Rule

$$ \lim*{x \to c} f(x)g(x) = \lim*{x \to c} f(x) \times \lim\_{x \to c} g(x) $$

## Composition Rule

$$ \because g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x) $$

$$ \because \lim\_{x \to A} f(x) = f(A) $$

$$ \therefore \lim*{x \to c} f(g(x)) = f\left(\lim*{x \to c} g(x)\right) = f(A) $$

## Squeeze Theorem

$$ \because g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x) $$

$$ \because \lim*{x \to k} g(x) = \lim*{x \to k} h(x) = L $$

$$ \therefore \lim\_{x \to k} f(x) = L $$

The squeeze theorem states that the limit of some function $$ f(x) $$ at $$ k $$ is equivalent to the limit of two other functions $$ g(x) $$ and $$ h(x) $$ at $$ k $$ iff $$ g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x) $$.

For example, suppose we have functions $$ f(x) = 0 $$, $$ g(x) = -x^2 $$, and $$ h(x) = x^2 $$. What is $$ \lim\_{x \to 0} f(x) $$?

The functions are graphed below, where $$ g(x) $$ is orange, $$ f(x) $$ is blue, and $$ h(x) $$ is green:

<Graph
  type="cartesian"
  viewBox={{
    x: [-5, 5],
    y: [-5, 5],
  }}
  expressions={[
    { math: '(x) => 0', color: 'green' },
    { math: '(x) => x**2', color: 'yellow' },
    { math: '(x) => -(x**2)', color: 'blue' },
  ]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[
    { text: 'f(x)=0', position: [4, 1] },
    { text: 'f(x)=x^2', position: [4, 5] },
    { text: 'f(x)=-x^2', position: [4, -5] },
  ]}
/>

From the graph, it becomes apparent that $$ g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x) $$, so we can use the squeeze theorem to find the limit.

Using limit techniques, we find that $$ \lim*{x \to 0} g(x) = \lim*{x \to 0} h(x) = 0 $$, and the squeeze theorem tells us that:

$$ \because g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x) $$

$$ \because \lim*{x \to 0} g(x) = \lim*{x \to 0} h(x) = 0 $$

$$ \therefore \lim\_{x \to 0} f(x) = 0 $$

And this matches what we would get for $$ \lim\_{x \to 0} f(x) $$ if we just performed direct substitution.

## Limits of Ratios of Polynomials

Given $$ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} $$:

- If the degree of $$ f(x) $$ is bigger than the degree of $$ g(x) $$, then $$ \lim\_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} $$ is either $$ \infty $$ or $$ -\infty $$.
- If the degree of $$ f(x) $$ is smaller than the degree of $$ g(x) $$, then $$ \lim\_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} $$ is 0.
- If the degree of $$ f(x) $$ is equivalent to the degree of $$ g(x) $$, then $$ \lim*{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} $$ is $$ \lim*{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{A}{B} $$, where $$ A $$ is the coefficient of the term with the highest power in $$ f(x) $$ and $$ B $$ is the coefficient of the term with the highest power in $$ g(x) $$.

## Intermediate Value Theorem

The **intermediate value theorem** states that for some function $$ f(x) $$ which is continuous over the interval $$ [a, b] $$, for all possible values in $$ [f(a), f(b)] $$, denoted as $$ c $$, there must be at least one value of x, denoted as $$ d $$, that is in $$ [a, b] $$ and that $$ f(d) = c $$.

For example, take the function $$ f(x) = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 $$:

<Graph
  type="cartesian"
  viewBox={{
    x: [-5, 5],
    y: [-5, 5],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => (x/2)**2', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[
    { text: 'f(x)=\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2', position: [4, 1] },
  ]}
/>

The intermediate value theorem states that for all possible values in $$ [f(a), f(b)] $$ there must be at least one value of x in the interval $$ [a, b] $$ which if it is taken as input of the function its output would be f(x):

<Graph
  type="cartesian"
  viewBox={{
    x: [-5, 5],
    y: [-5, 5],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => (x/2)**2', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[
    { text: 'f(x)=\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2', position: [4, 1] },
    { text: '(a, f(a))', position: [2, 2] },
    { text: '(b, f(b))', position: [4, 5] },
  ]}
  points={[
    { x: 2, y: 1, color: 'white' },
    { x: 4, y: 4, color: 'white' },
  ]}
/>

In simple terms, The intermediate value theorem states that if $$ f(x) $$ is continuous in the interval $$ [f(a), f(b)] $$ in the y-direction, then it must also be continuous over the interval $$ [a, b] $$ over the x-direction, and there could be more than one value in $$ [a, b] $$ which matches some definite value in $$ [f(a), f(b)] $$; in other words, for the some output value there must be at least one input which results in it.
