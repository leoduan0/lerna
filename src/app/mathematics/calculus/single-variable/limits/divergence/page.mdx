# Divergence

## Divergence by Unequal One-Handed Limits

A limit would not exist if the left-hand and the right-hand limit is not equivalent. One possible reason for this is that the left hand and the right hand limit are not equal to each other.

<Example>
Find whether $$ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x} $$ exists, and if so, what it is. The graph of $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $$ is as follows:

<Graph
  type={'cartesian'}
  viewBox={{
    x: [-10, 10],
    y: [-5, 5],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => 1/x', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[{ text: 'f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}', position: [3, 3] }]}
/>

First, we begin by figuring out what the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit is.

| x    | -1  | -0.1 | -0.01 | -0.001 | 0           | 0.001 | 0.01 | 0.1 | 1   |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ---- | --- | --- |
| f(x) | -1  | -10  | -100  | -1000  | (undefined) | 1000  | 100  | 10  | 1   |

From the graph, it is apparent that as x approaches 0 from the left-hand side, y approaches $$ -\infty $$, and as $$ y $$ approaches from the right-hand side, $$ y $$ approaches $$ \infty $$. Such phenomenons, that when the input value approaches some finite number and its corresponding output value the left-hand and the right-hand limit are not equivalent to each other, are called divergence. Thus:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $$

$$ \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = -\infty $$ and $$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = \infty $$

And since the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are not equivalent in this case, the limit for this function when x approaches 0 does not exist:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $$

$$ \because \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) $$

$$ \therefore \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) $$ does not exist

</Example>

## Divergence by Oscillation

Certain limits do not exist because when approaching $$ -\infty $$ or $$ \infty $$, the correspond $$ y $$ value does not approach some definite value but changes according to a certain pattern (wave functions exhibit this type of behavior); they constantly oscillate, or they are **oscillatory**.

<Example>
Find whether $$ lim_{x \to infty} sin(x) $$ exists, and if so, what it is. The graph of $$ f(x) = sin(x) $$ is as follows:

<Graph
  type={'cartesian'}
  viewBox={{
    x: [-10, 10],
    y: [-5, 5],
  }}
  expressions={[{ math: '(x) => Math.sin(x)', color: 'green' }]}
  subdivisions={4}
  annotations={[{ text: 'f(x) = \\sin(x)', position: [8, 7] }]}
/>

First, we begin by figuring out what the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit is.

| $$ x $$    | $$ \frac{\pi}{6} $$ | $$ \frac{\pi}{4} $$      | $$ \frac{\pi}{3} $$      | $$ \frac{\pi}{2} $$ | $$ \frac{2\pi}{3} $$     | $$ \frac{3\pi}{4} $$     | $$ \frac{5\pi}{6} $$ | $$ \pi $$ |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- | --------- |
| $$ f(x) $$ | $$ \frac{1}{2} $$   | $$ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$ | $$ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$ | $$ 1 $$             | $$ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$ | $$ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$ | $$ \frac{1}{2} $$    | $$ 0 $$   |

As we can see, as we gradually take bigger values of $$ x $$, its corresponding $$ y $$ value, albeit with pattern, changes without converging into one definite value, which implies that it is impossible to determine what the limit is. Such phenomenons, that when the input value approaches infinity and its corresponding output value changes with pattern and does not approach some definite number, are called oscillation. Thus:

$$ lim_{x \to \infty} \sin(x) $$ does not exist
