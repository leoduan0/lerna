# Manipulation

Certain limits may appear undefined at first, but with some manipulation, it would still be possible to find the limit.

<Block text={'Example'}>

Find whether $$ \lim_{x \to -3} \frac{3x^3+9x^2+13x+12}{x+3} $$ exists, and if so, what it is.

At first glance, it may appear as if this limit does not exist as direct substitution would yield a 0 in the denominator. However, we can manipulate this function so that direct substitution would not yield a 0 in the denominator. In this case, we can simply divide the two polynomials, resulting in:

$$ \lim_{x \to -3} 2x^2+3x+4 $$

And then, we can substitue -3 directly into the function as input to acquire the limit, thus:

$$ \lim_{x \to -3} \frac{3x^3+9x^2+13x+12}{x+3} = 13 $$
