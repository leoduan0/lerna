# Set Theory

## Set

A set is a collection of elements.

The order of constituent elements of a set does not matter (although, in an extension of sets called “multisets”, the order of constituent elements does matter).

Sets can be defined using this notation:

<Block text={'Example'}>

A set $ A $ that contains the first five positive natural numbers is $ A=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} $

</Block>

Some sets cannot be (practically) defined (or written down) using this notation, such as infinite sets (_e.g._ domain and range of most functions). Instead, a conditional statement is used to define such sets:

<Block text={'Example'}>

A set that is the range of $f(x)=x^2$ (_i.e._ $ \operatorname{rng}(f) $) is $ \{y \geq 0 | y \in \mathbb{R} \} $.

</Block>

## Subset

$ A $ is a subset of $ B $ if all elements of $ A $ are elements of $ B $. This relationship is denoted with $ A \subseteq B $.

<Block text={'Example'}>

If $ A = \{2, 3, 1\} $ and $ B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, then $ A \subseteq B $.

</Block>

The symbol $ \subset $ is identical to $ \subseteq $ except that $ A \subseteq A $ for any set $ A $ but $ A \not\subset A $ for all sets $ A $.

## Empty Set

An empty set, denoted with $ \{\} $ or $ \emptyset $, is a (the only) set whose cardinal number is 0.

<Block text={'Special Properties'}>

- $ \{\} \subseteq A $ for any set $ A $
- $ \{\} \cup A = A $ for any set $ A $
- $ \{\} \cap A = \{\} $ for any set $ A $

</Block>
