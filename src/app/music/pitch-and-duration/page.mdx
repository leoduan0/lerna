# Pitch and Duration

Music centers around **sound**, arguably the cornerstone of the art.

One important aspect of sound in music is **pitch**. Put simply, it is how high or low a given sound is.

Another important aspect of sound in music is **duration**. Put simply, it is how long or short a given sound is.

Music, on the other hand, is simply the art which deals with assembling different varieties of sound in some way.

These pitches and durations of sounds are denoted using **musical notation**, in which musicians can parse and play the music written by a composer.

## Instruments

**Instruments** are tools which one can use to make sounds.

Different instruments can vary dramatically from one another. Most notably, instruments can vary in timbre (the 'quality' of sound), sound production mechanism (how a player can produce sound on that instrument), range (how high or low can the instrument play. Though the term often refers to the pitches which the instrument most often plays), among other physical and musical aspects.

Below are some examples of the sounds which different instruments make. All notes are half notes at C4 except for bass, which is in C2:

- Trumpet <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c4_trumpet.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
- Trombone <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c4_trombone.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
- Alto Sax <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c4_alto_sax.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
- Tenor Sax <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c4_tenor_sax.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
- Piano <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c4_piano.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
- Guitar <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c4_guitar.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
- Bass <Audio source={'/music/pitch_and_duration/c2_bass.mp3'} type={'mp3'} />
