**Lerna** is a collection of learning resources.

## Incentive

The dilemma with learning resources is that you can either:

1. pick one resource and stick with it exclusively, or
2. use a plethora of resources from all over the place.

The problem with 1) is that if you ever find yourself in need of understanding something that is not covered by your selected resource or that your selected resource does not explain something well enough, you are forced to consult another resource, which could confuse you if they are using two different approaches to describe the same concept.
The problem with 2) is that different resources tend to have very different ways of approaching the same topic; even though the reality that they describe is the same, the difference in their approaches is likely going to confuse you (tell me if it's $W = P \Delta V$ or $W = -P \Delta V$!!!).

My ultimate vision for Lerna is to become an extensive set of learning resources (including but not restricted to notes) that serves as a one-time stop for all kinds of learners, including those seeking to:

- Learn a topic for the first time
- Review a topic
- Get answers to common questions (_e.g._ tell me if it's $W = P \Delta V$ or $W = -P \Delta V$!!!)
- Do practice problems

Even though the content is (mostly) tailored to the [International Baccalaureate Programme](https://www.ibo.org), anyone should be able to take advantage of this platform.

I am always open to ideas, suggestions, and errata. If you wish to point anything out, please visit the [Lerna issues GitHub repository](https://github.com/leoduan0/lerna-issues/issues).

Have fun learning!
