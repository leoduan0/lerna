# Circuits

**Circuits** involve the study of how electricity and magnetic entities behave inside an electrical circuit.

## Current

Given a wire, the amount of **current** flowing inside it is defined as follows:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'I=nAvq'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'I',
      annotation: <span>Current</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'n',
      annotation: <span>Number of electrons per unit volume</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'A',
      annotation: <span>Cross-sectional area of wire</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'v',
      annotation: <span>Drift velocity of electrons</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q',
      annotation: <span>Charge of each electron</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

Current is also the change in charge over time.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'I=\\frac{dq}{dt}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'I',
      annotation: <span>Current</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q',
      annotation: <span>Charge</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 't',
      annotation: <span>Time</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Power

The amount of **power** dissipated by a node with current $$ I $$ flowing through it and electric potential $$ V $$ around it is given by the following equation:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'P=IV'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'P',
      annotation: <span>Power</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I',
      annotation: <span>Current</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Resistance

The amount of **resistance** is a resistive material is given with the following equation:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'R=\\frac{\\rho L}{A}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'R',
      annotation: <span>Resistance</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\rho',
      annotation: <span>Resistivity of material</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'L',
      annotation: <span>Distance travelled by the electricity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'A',
      annotation: <span>Cross-sectional area of the wire</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

Difference in the surrounding temperature often results in a different resistivity inside a material. Thus:

<Rule
  statement={
    <Math math={'\\rho=\\rho_0(1+\\alpha \\Delta T)'} type={'block'} />
  }
  terms={[
    {
      term: '\\rho',
      annotation: <span>Actual resistivity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\rho_0',
      annotation: <span>Original resistivity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\alpha',
      annotation: <span>Temperature coefficient of resistivity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\Delta T',
      annotation: <span>Change in temperature</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws

<Rule
  statement={
    <ul>
      <li>
        The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a
        point is zero (the amount of current flowing into a node is equivalent
        to the amount of current flowing out of that node).
      </li>
      <li>
        The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any
        closed loop is zero (the sum of changes in the potential differences
        (voltage) in a closed loop is 0).
      </li>
    </ul>
  }
/>

For series and parallel circuits, Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws can be written in equation form as follows.

## Series Circuit

A **series circuit** is a circuit where the electricity has only one pathway to flow from one battery terminal to the other.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'V=V_1+V_2+V_3+...+V_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'V',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at source</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_1',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point 1</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_2',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point 2</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_3',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point 3</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_n',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point n</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'I=I_1=I_2=I_3=...=I_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'I',
      annotation: <span>Current at source</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_1',
      annotation: <span>Current at point 1</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_2',
      annotation: <span>Current at point 2</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_3',
      annotation: <span>Current at point 3</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_n',
      annotation: <span>Current at point n</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'R=R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'R',
      annotation: <span>Total resistance of the circuit</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_1',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor 1</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_2',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor 2</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_3',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor 3</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_n',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor n</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Parallel Circuit

A **parallel circuit** is a circuit where the electricity has more than one pathway to flow from one battery terminal to the other.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'V=V_1=V_2=V_3=...=V_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'V',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at source</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_1',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point 1</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_2',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point 2</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_3',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point 3</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_n',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential at point n</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'I=I_1+I_2+I_3+...+I_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'I',
      annotation: <span>Current at source</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_1',
      annotation: <span>Current at point 1</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_2',
      annotation: <span>Current at point 2</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_3',
      annotation: <span>Current at point 3</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'I_n',
      annotation: <span>Current at point n</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
<Rule
  statement={
    <Math
      math={
        '\\frac{1}{R}=\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2}+\\frac{1}{R_3}+...+\\frac{1}{R_n}'
      }
      type={'block'}
    />
  }
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'R',
      annotation: <span>Total resistance of the circuit</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_1',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor 1</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_2',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor 2</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_3',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor 3</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'R_n',
      annotation: <span>Resistance of resistor n</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
