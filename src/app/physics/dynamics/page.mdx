# Dynamics

**Dynamics** is the study of forces.

## Force

The **force** of an object is its mass multiplied by its acceleration.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'F=ma'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: <span>Force</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm',
      annotation: <span>Mass</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'a',
      annotation: <span>Acceleration</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

The study of forces involves three key empirical laws, called the **Newton's Laws of Motion**:

<Rule
  statement={
    <ul>
      <li>
        A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight
        line, unless acted upon by a force.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its
        momentum equals the force.
      </li>
      <li>
        If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same
        magnitude but opposite directions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  }
/>

The force is also the first derivative of momentum with respect to time.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'F=\\frac{dp}{dt}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: <span>Force</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'p',
      annotation: <span>Momentum</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 't',
      annotation: <span>Time</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Spring

The force from a spring is given by the **Hooke's Law**, and is proportional to the **spring constant**, which depends on the spring, of that spring and the how much the spring is compressed (the distance between end of the spring and its equilibrium position):

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'F_{spring}=kx'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F_{spring}',
      annotation: <span>Force from a spring</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'k',
      annotation: <span>Spring constant</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'x',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Distance between end of the spring and its equilibrium position
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Friction

**Friction** is the resistance to motion created when two objects have relative velocity and are in contact. There are two different types of frictions: static friction, and kinetic friction.

### Static Friction

**Static friction** is the friction that's present when one object is stationary with respect to another object it's in contact with.

An example of static friction would be the resistive force present when you are trying to move an initially stationary box on the ground.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'F_s = \\mu_s F_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F_s',
      annotation: <span>Static friction</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\mu_s',
      annotation: <span>Coefficient of static friction</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'F_n',
      annotation: <span>Normal force</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Kinetic Friction

**Kinetic friction** is the friction that's present when one object is moving with respect to another object it's in contact with.

An example of kinetic friction would be the resistive force you would have to work against in order to keep that box moving.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'F_k = \\mu_k F_n'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F_k',
      annotation: <span>Kinetic friction</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\mu_k',
      annotation: <span>Coefficient of kinetic friction</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'F_n',
      annotation: <span>Normal force</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
