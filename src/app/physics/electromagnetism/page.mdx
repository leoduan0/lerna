# Electromagnetism

**Electromagnetism** is the study of the nature of two fields: the **electric field** and the **magnetic field**.

In this chapter in particular, you will encounter many phenomena which appear to be unfounded or even unintuitive. However, it is analogous to many things the average person is familiar with, such as gravity always pulling and never pushing; there's no reason for it, it's just is the way it is. We ask you to think back at this analogy if you encounter anything that appears to have no explanation.

## Electric Field and Charge

The **electric field** is, as the name suggests, a field. Fluctuations in the electric field are called **charges**.

Charges can take any real number as its value, and the distinguishment between positive and negative charges is necessary.

Just like gravity, electric field produced by an object can affect the surroundings without being in direct contact.

Positive charges create electric fields pointing outwards in all directions.

Negative charges create electric fields pointing inwards in all directions.

Any fluctuations within the electric field can have an effect on physical objects.

The strength of an electric field is defined as the amount of force experienced by an object with a charge $$ q $$ that's approaching zero divided by its charge.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E = \\lim_{q \\to 0} \\frac{F}{q}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E',
      annotation: <span>Electric field strength</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: <span>Electric force</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q',
      annotation: <span>Charge of object</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

The reason why the electric charge of the object has to be approaching zero (denoted by the limit) is because if the charge of our test object is not zero, then it would affect the electric field, distorting our results.

In an empty electric field but two charges with charges $$ q_1 $$ and $$ q_2 $$ respectively, the amount of force they exert on each other is given by the following equation.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'F = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Force exerted by and on <Math math={'q_1'} type={'inline'} /> and{' '}
          <Math math={'q_2'} type={'inline'} />
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'k',
      annotation: <span>Coulomb Constant</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q_1',
      annotation: <span>Charge of the first charge</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q_i',
      annotation: <span>Charge of the second charge</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'r',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Distance between <Math math={'q_1'} type={'inline'} /> and{' '}
          <Math math={'q_2'} type={'inline'} />
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

Suppose that $$ q_1 $$ and $$ q_2 $$ are both positive or both negative, we see that $$ F $$ is also positive. However, in the case that either one of them is negative, $$ F $$ becomes negative, thus becoming a force which pulls the two charges together. Thus, like charges repel, unlike charges attract.

<Rule
  statement={
    <ul>
      <li>Like charges repel</li>
      <li>Unlike charges attract</li>
    </ul>
  }
/>

From the two equations, we see that we can substitute the second equation into the first. Suppose our test charge is $$ q_1 $$. Then, $$ q_1 $$ (in the second equation) cancels out with $$ q $$ (in the first equation), giving us the following, which tells us the strength of the electric field created by the original charge in the field $$ q_2 $$, which we will now denote as just $$ q $$, experienced by some test charge a distance away.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E=k\\frac{q}{r^2}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E',
      annotation: <span>Electric field strength</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q',
      annotation: <span>Charge</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'r',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Distance between <Math math={'q'} type={'inline'} /> and some test
          charge
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Electric Potential

The **electric potential** is the amount of work that is needed to move a set amount of charge through a distance. It is analogous to potential energy.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'V=\\frac{W}{q}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'W',
      annotation: <span>Work</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q',
      annotation: <span>Charge</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Voltage

The **voltage** is the change in electric potential from one point to the next. It is often confused with the electric potential; albeit that they are related, they are **not** the same concept.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'\\Delta V = V_B - V_A'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: '\\Delta V',
      annotation: <span>Change in electric potential (voltage)</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_B',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential of the particle at point B</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V_A',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential of the particle at point A</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

We can relate the voltage with the electric field using the following:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E = \\frac{V}{d}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E',
      annotation: <span>Electric field strength</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V',
      annotation: <span>Voltage</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'd',
      annotation: <span>Distance</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Electronvolt

One **electronvolt** ($$ eV $$) is defined as the amount of work needed to take one electron charge across a potential difference of one volt, thus:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'eV = e'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'eV',
      annotation: <span>One electronvolt</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'e',
      annotation: <span>Charge of one electron</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Capacitors

**Capacitors** are devices which that can store electrical energy by accumulating electric charges that create electric fields.

Capacitors have an inherent property called **capacitance**, which is defined as the amount of charge that can be stored per unit of electric potential.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'C=\\frac{q}{V}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'C',
      annotation: <span>Capacitance</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'q',
      annotation: <span>Charge</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'V',
      annotation: <span>Electric potential</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

There are many types of capacitors. One common type is called the **parallel plate capacitor**.

In a parallel plate capacitor, two conducting electrical plates of area $$ A $$ are placed parallel to each other a distance $$ d $$ apart in an environment with permittivity $$ \epsilon $$. The capacitance of the capacitor is given by the following equation. If there is a dielectric material with a dielectric constant of $$ \kappa $$ inserted in between the plates, then multiply by $$ \kappa $$.

<Rule
  statement={
    <Math math={'C = \\kappa \\epsilon \\frac{A}{d}'} type={'block'} />
  }
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'C',
      annotation: <span>Capacitance</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\kappa',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Dielectric constant of the dielectric material (if there is one)
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: '\\epsilon',
      annotation: <span>Permittivity of environment</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'A',
      annotation: <span>Area of plate</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'd',
      annotation: <span>Distance between the two plates</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

        alt={''}
      />
    }
    number={5}
    text={<span>A parallel plate capacitor.</span>}

    }

Next, to find the amount of energy stored in a capacitor, we think about the amount of work that needs to be done to move all the charges from one of the plates to the other. Since $$ V=\frac{W}{q} $$, we need to add up all the work done by moving some charge through the electric potential; in other words, we need to integrate voltage with respect to charge. Suppose that the total charge of the capacitor is $$ Q $$:

| Procedure                              | Annotation                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$ W=\int_{0}^{Q} V \,dq $$           | Integrating voltage with respect to charge along a capacitor with a total charge of $$ Q $$. |
| $$ W=\int_{0}^{Q} \frac{q}{C} \,dq $$ | Replace $$ V $$ since $$ V=\frac{q}{C} $$.                                                   |
| $$ W=\frac{Q^2}{2C} $$                 | Integrate and evaluate bounds.                                                               |

Thus:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E=\\frac{Q^2}{2C}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E',
      annotation: <span>Energy stored in the capacitor</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'Q',
      annotation: <span>Total charge of the capacitor</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'C',
      annotation: <span>Capacitance of the capacitor</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Magnetic Field

The **magnetic field strength** $$ B $$ experienced from a current source with current $$ B $$ from $$ r $$ meters away is given by the following equation.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'B=\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'B',
      annotation: <span>Magnetic field strength</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\mu_0',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Magnetic constant, equals to{' '}
          <Math
            math={'4\\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{m \\cdot kg}{s^2A^2}'}
            type={'inline'}
          />
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'I',
      annotation: <span>Current</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'r',
      annotation: <span>Distance from the source of current</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
