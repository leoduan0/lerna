# Energy

There are many types of **energies**, and each type of energy has its own unique definition.

A single object may have multiple types of energy (_e.g._ a moving object has gravitational potential, kinetic, and thermal energy at the same time).

## Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic energy** refers to the energy in a moving object (_e.g._ a moving car).

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E_k',
      annotation: <span>Kinetic energy</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm',
      annotation: <span>Mass</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'v',
      annotation: <span>Velocity</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Potential Energy

**Potential Energy** refers to any type of energy which has not been expressed.

### Gravitational

**Gravitational potential energy** refers to the potential for an object held some distance from some massive object to do work.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E_g = mgh'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E_g',
      annotation: <span>Gravitation potential energy</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm',
      annotation: <span>Mass of object</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'g',
      annotation: <span>Gravitational acceleration</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'h',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Distance between object and the source of gravitational acceleration
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Conservation of Energy

Within a closed system, energy is conserved, meaning that it's never created or destroyed.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'E_{total~f} = E_{total~i}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'E_{total~f}',
      annotation: <span>Total final energy</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'E_{total~i}',
      annotation: <span>Total initial energy</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Work

**Work** refers to the change in energy.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'W = \\Delta E'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'W',
      annotation: <span>Work</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\Delta E',
      annotation: <span>Change in energy</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

If a force is applied to an object at angle $$ \theta $$ from the horizontal, the work done by the entity which applied the force is given by the following expression:

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'W = Fd\\cos(\\theta)'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'W',
      annotation: <span>Work</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: <span>Force</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'd',
      annotation: <span>Distance travelled while the force was applying</span>,
    },
    {
      term: '\\theta',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Angle between <Math math={'F'} type={'inline'} /> and the object
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Power

**Power** is the rate at which work is done.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'P = \\frac{dW}{dt}'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'P',
      annotation: <span>Power</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'W',
      annotation: <span>Work</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 't',
      annotation: <span>Time</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

The power is also equal to the force multiplied by the velocity.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math={'P = Fv'} type={'block'} />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'P',
      annotation: <span>Power</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: <span>Force</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'v',
      annotation: <span>Velocity</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
