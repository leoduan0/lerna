# Gravitation

**Gravitation** is the study of gravity.

## Law of Gravitation

**Newton's law of universal gravitation** gives the amount of gravitational force between two objects.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math="F_{gravity} = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}" type="block" />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'F_{gravity}',
      annotation: <span>Force by gravity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'G',
      annotation: <span>Gravitational constant</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm_1',
      annotation: <span>Mass of 1st object</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm_2',
      annotation: <span>Mass of 2nd object</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'r',
      annotation: (
        <span>Distance between the center of masses of the two objects</span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Orbital Velocity

Given an object under the influence of some body which produces a gravitational field, the **orbital velocity** is defined as the velocity that the object needs to orbit the body steadily.

<Rule
  statement={
    <Math math="v_{orbit} = \sqrt{\frac{Gm_{body}}{r}}" type="block" />
  }
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'v_{escape}',
      annotation: <span>Orbital velocity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'G',
      annotation: <span>Gravitational constant</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm_{body}',
      annotation: (
        <span>Mass of the body (which the object orbits around)</span>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'r',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Distance between the center of masses of the object and the body
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Escape Velocity

Given an object under the influence of some body which produces a gravitational field, the **escape velocity** is defined as the velocity that the object needs to have to escape the body's gravitational pull.

<Rule
  statement={
    <Math math="v_{escape} = \sqrt{\frac{2Gm_{body}}{r}}" type="block" />
  }
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'v_{escape}',
      annotation: <span>Escape velocity</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm_{body}',
      annotation: (
        <span>Mass of the body (which the object orbits around)</span>
      ),
    },
    {
      term: 'r',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Distance between the center of masses of the object and the body
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>
