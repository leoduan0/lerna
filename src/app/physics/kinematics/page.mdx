# Kinematics

**Kinematics** is the study of how entities move within space.

## Scalars vs Vectors

A **scalar** is a quantity that does not have a direction. _e.g._ mass, distance, speed.

A **vector** is a quantity that has a direction. _e.g._ displacement, velocity.

Concepts denoted by vectors have an arrow on top of its corresponding symbol to indicate that it is a vector. _e.g._ $v$ refers to speed but $\vec{v}$ refers to velocity.

The concept of scalars and vectors stem from mathematics.

## Displacement

**Displacement** refers to the net change in the position of an object. It is a vector. It is denoted with $\vec{s}$.

**Distance** refers to the change in position of an object. It is a scalar. It is denoted with $s$.

<Block text="Example">

Suppose a person travelled to a place $A$ and then walked to another point $B$.

The distance is how far the person has travelled. The displacement is how far the person has moved cumulatively.

    />
  }
  number={1}
/>

In this case, the distance travelled is $200m+300m=500m$ while the displacement is the final position minus the initial position _i.e._ $0-300m=-300m$.

Note that there is a negative sign. This is because we have chosen the right side to be positive, and since the person displaced to the left, displacement is a vector, and vectors have a direction, we need to present the displacement with the negative sign.
