# Measurements

**Measurements** are recorded values of a certain quatity using tools.

Measurements in science are quantitative, involving numbers, and it is important to be able to express a measurement to the correct **accuracy**, how close one's measurement of a quantity is to the true value of that quantity, and **precision**, how close one's measurements of a quantity are to each other.

<Block text={'Definition'}>
  **Accuracy**: how close one's measurement of a quantity is to the true value
  of that quantity.
</Block>

<Block text={'Precision'}>
  Precision: how close one's measurements of a quantity are to each other.
</Block>

It's important to realize that it is impossible to gain a 100% accurate measurement of any quantity, as that would require an infinitely accurate measuring tool. Thus, every measurement has a certain amount of **uncertainty**, the range around a measured value of a quantity where its accuracy cannot be further increased.

## Significant Figures

**Significant figures** allows the expression of the value as well as the accuracy of a numerical measurement. A figure, or a digit, in a measured is is significant if it contributes to representing the accuracy of a measured result.

<Rule
  statement={
    <p>
      Figures that contribute to representing the accuracy of a measured result
      are significant.
    </p>
  }
/>

<Block text={'Example'}>
  The number $$ 345.12 $$ has 5 significant figures, as all digits inside
  contribute to representing the accuracy of the measured result.
</Block>

<Block text={'Example'}>
  The number $$ 305.1 $$ has 4 significant figures, for the same reason.
</Block>

<Block text={'Example'}>
  The number $$ 100 $$ has only 1 significant figure. The reason for this is
  because $$ 10 $$ does not imply that the measurement is exactly $$ 10 $$. For
  example, if someone measures the length of an object with a ruler that has
  centimeters as the smallest unit, and measures that object to be $$ 10 $$mm
  long, it's possible that, because the ruler is not precise enough, the length
  of that object is not exactly $$ 10 $$mm, thus the person is only certain that
  $$ 1 $$ should be in the tens digit, but not certain if it is exactly $$ 10
  $$, $$ 11 $$, or $$ 12 $$.

    />
  </Align>
</Block>

<Block text={'Example'}>
  The number $$ 00100 $$ has 1 significant figure. The two zeroes after the 1 is
  not significant (for the same reason listed in the previous example), and the
  two zeroes before the 1 are not significant either because they do not
  contribute in reflecting the precision of the input.
</Block>

<Block text={'Example'}>
  The number $$ 100.1 $$ has 4 significant figures. Unlike the previous example,
  the 1 in the tenths digit implies that the input is precise to the tenths
  digit, thus the measurer is certain that it is 100.1.
</Block>

<Block text={'Example'}>
  The number $$ 100. $$ has 3 significant figures. A decimal place inserted
  after the ones digit implies that the certainty of an input goes to the ones
  digit, implying that all digits up until the decimal places are significant.
  It is important to note that rarely are numbers written in similar style as $$
  100. $$. In a situation like this, the number is represented using scientific
  notation.
</Block>

Realize that numbers which are not measured have an infinite amount of significant figures, implying that they do not contribute to the certainty of the result.

<Block text={'Example'}>
  If $$ x = 102.0 $$, $$ 2x $$ would be $$ 2 \cdot 102.0 = 204.0 $$, and we do
  not have to round to one significant figure because the $$ 2 $$ in this case
  is not a measurement - it has infinite precision.
</Block>

Conversion factors, like $$ \frac{3600s}{1h} $$ or $$ \frac{1km}{1000m} $$ are also _not_ measured quantities, and thus have an infinite amount of significant figures.

## Scientific Notation

The purpose of **scientific notations** is to denote the amount of significant figures in any situation in a concise way. It comes in the form of a number in the front, usually a decimal, with only one digit in from of the decimal, multiplied by 10 to some power.

<Rule
  statement={
    <>
      <p>To form a number in scientific notation:</p>
      <ol>
        <span>Remove all non-significant figures</span>
        <span>Rewrite so that the first digit is in the ones place.</span>
        <span>
          Multiply it to a power of ten which would make it equivalent to the
          original value.
        </span>
      </ol>
    </>
  }
/>

<Block text={'Example'}>

To represent $$ 100. $$ in scientific notation and still convey the fact that it has 3 significant digits:

| Procedure             | Annotation                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$ 100. $$            | Remove all non-significant figures (there are none in this case).                                                                                             |
| $$ 1.00 $$            | Move the decimal place as many times as needed until only one digit is left in the front.                                                                     |
| $$ 1.00 \cdot 10^2 $$ | Multiply the number by a certain power of 10 in order to make it numerical equivalent to the number we started with. In this case, it's 10 to the power of 2. |

Thus, $$ 1.00 \cdot 10^2 $$ is $$ 100. $$ written in scientific notation.

</Block>

Note that in scientific notation, **all** figures in the decimal in the front are significant.

<Block text={'Example'}>
Given $$ 03560012.1420 $$, it can be expressed in scientific notation by following the rules.

| Procedure                     | Annotation                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$ 03560012.1420 $$           |                                                                                     |
| $$ 3560012.1420 $$            | Remove all non-significant figures.                                                 |
| $$ 3.5600121420 $$            | Rewrite so that the first digit is in the ones place.                               |
| $$ 3.5600121420 \cdot 10^6 $$ | Multiply it to a power of ten which would make it equivalent to the original value. |

$$ 3.5600121420 \cdot 10^6 $$ is $$ 03560012.1420 $$ in scientifc notation.

## Uncertainties

As mentioned, it is impossible to measure something with total accuracy or certainty, thus one must be able to express the amount of **uncertainty** they might hold regarding a measurement.

Given a ruler that measures to a centimeter and an object as follows, how can we express our measurement?

<Align type={'center'}>
  <Figure
    image={
      <Image
        src={'/physics/measurements/figure_2.svg'}
        width={384}
        height={64}
        alt={''}
      />
    }
    number={2}
    text={
      <span>
        A ruler and an object of which's length is pending measurement
      </span>
    }
  />
</Align>

It is clear that the object is more than 2cm and less than 3cm, so if we were to measure the length of this object in centimeters, we can be certain that the ones digit is the number $$ 2 $$.

Realize that because the most precise unit for this ruler is centimeters, it is thus impossible to accurately determine the precision of the next digit (the tenths digit). The convention, however, is to guess the digit after the last digit that one is certain about from measurement, and then put in an uncertainty. Note that the uncertainty is related to the smallest precision of the measurement tool, but for simplicity, we will assume that the uncertainty is half of the smallest precision of our measuring tool, or half of a centimeter.

We will guess tenths digit to be $$ 5 $$, but realize that any reasonable guess (_e.g._ $$ 2 $$, $$ 3 $$, $$ 4 $$, $$ 6 $$, etc) are also valid. Then, our measurement can be expressed like this: $$ 2.5 \pm 0.5 cm $$.

Uncertainties may be used in conjunction with scientific notation, like $$ 4 \cdot 10^{-13} \pm 1 \cdot 10^{-13} m $$, $$ 4 \cdot 10^5 \pm 3 \cdot 10^5 \frac{N}{m^2} $$.

### Absolute Uncertainties

Uncertainties that are expressed as a number (_e.g._ $$ \pm 3 $$, $$ \pm 2.1 $$, $$ \pm 3.14 $$) are called **absolute uncertainties**.

### Relative Uncertainties

**Relative uncertainties** denotes by how much with respect to the number is the uncertainty. The relative uncertainty can be acquired by dividing the absolute uncertainty by the number.

<Block text={'Example'}>
  Given the measurement $$ 10.5 \pm 5.3 $$, the relative uncertainty is $$ \frac{\vphantom{}5.3}{10.5} \approx 0.50476 $$, or that the uncertainty is 50% of the number.

## Arithmetic

When performing operations on numbers, its significant figures can be calculated by following the following rules:

<Rule
  statement={
    <ul>
      <li>
        When adding or subtracting, retain significance to the same number of
        decimal places as the input with the fewest significant decimal places.
      </li>
      <li>
        When multiplying or dividing, retain significance with the same number
        of significant figures as the input with the fewest significant figures.
      </li>
    </ul>
  }
/>

It is good practice to put an underline under the last significant digit while calculating, and round off only at the very end.

<Block text={'Example'}>
Given $$ 100 + 32 $$, the $$ 100 $$ is significant to the hundreds digit, and $$ 32 $$ is significant to the ones digit. Using the rules, the significance of the result would be retained to the same number of decimal places as the input with the fewest significant decimal places, or the hundreds digit.

| Procedure               | Annotation                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| $$ 100 + 32 $$          |                                  |
| $$ = \underline{1}32 $$ | Evaluate.                        |
| $$ = 132 $$             | Underline the digit to round to. |
| $$ = 100 $$             | Round.                           |

</Block>

<Block text={'Example'}>
Given $$ 100 \\times 32 $$, the $$ 100 $$has 1 significant digit, and $$ 32 $$ has two significant digits. Using the rules, the significance of the result would be retained with the same number of significant figures as the input with the fewest significant figures.

| Procedure                | Annotation                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| $$ 100 \times 32 $$      |                                  |
| $$ = 3200 $$             | Evaluate.                        |
| $$ = \underline{3}200 $$ | Underline the digit to round to. |
| $$ = 3000 $$             | Round.                           |

</Block>

When dealing with numbers with uncertainties, the uncertainties also need to be evaluated accordingly in a process called **propagation**.

<Rule
  statement={
    <ul>
      <li>When adding or subtracting, add the absolute uncertainties.</li>
      <li>When multiplying or dividing, add the relative uncertainties</li>
      <li>
        Any arithmetic applied to uncertainties follow the same rule of
        significant figures.
      </li>
    </ul>
  }
/>

| $$ (5.8 \pm 2.2 m)(3.1 \pm 0.9 m) $$                 | Multiply the coefficient $$ 2 $$ into one of the measurements.

| $$ 1\underline{7}.98 \pm \underline{6}6.963\% m^2 $$ | Find the relative uncertainties of each of the measurements, then add them together, and plug back into the evaluated number. The relative uncertainty for $$ 5.8 \pm 2.2 m $$ is $$ \frac{2.2}{5.8} \approx 0.3\underline{7}931 $$ and for $$ 3.1 \pm 0.9 m $$ it's $$ \frac{0.9}{3.1} \approx 0.\underline{2}9032 $$. Added together, it is $$ \approx 0.3\underline{7}931 + 0.\underline{2}9032 = 0.\underline{6}6963 $$, or $$ \underline{6}6.963\% $$. |
| $$ 1\underline{7}.98 \pm \underline{1}2.04 m^2 $$    | Convert the relative uncertainty back into absolute uncertainty by multiplying the relative uncertainty into the number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

</Block>

Note that uncertainties will always have to match the number it corresponds to in _place value_. If any arithmetic operation results in a difference in the place value between the two, round the number to the same amount of place values as the uncertainty. _e.g._ $$ 2.9 \pm 3 m $$ should become $$ 3 \pm 3 m $$.
