# Momentum

The **momentum** of an object is its mass multiplied by its velocity.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math="p=mv" type="block" />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'p',
      annotation: <span>Momentum</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm',
      annotation: <span>Mass</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'v',
      annotation: <span>Velocity</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Conservation of Momentum

The **conservation of momentum** states that momentum is always **conserved** in an isolated system.

This means that, within an isolated system, momentum can never spontaneously appear or disappear.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math="p_{total~i} = p_{total~f}" type="block" />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'p_{total~i}',
      annotation: <span>Total initial momentum of a closed system</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'p_{total~f}',
      annotation: (
        <span>
          Total final momentum of a closed system after any amount of time
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Impulse

The **impulse** of an object is the change in that object's momentum that resulted from a force being applied to it for some amount of time.

<Rule
  statement={<Math math="\Delta p=Ft" type="block" />}
  terms={[
    {
      term: '\\Delta p',
      annotation: <span>Impulse</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'F',
      annotation: <span>Force</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 't',
      annotation: <span>time</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Collisions

Suppose there are two objects of mass and velocity of $m_1$, $v_{1,i}$, and $m_2$, $v_{2,i}$ respectively. There are three types main type of **collisions**.

- **Perfect elastic collision** refers to a collision where all the kinetic energy remains in the system (none gets lost by heat, sound, friction, etc). Both the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy can be applied to this type of collision.

<Align type="center">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$m_1v_{1,i} + m_2v_{2,i} = m_1v_{1,f} + m_2v_{2,f}$$

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,i}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,i}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,f}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,f}^2$$

</Align>

- **Inelastic collision** refers to a collision where not all the kinetic energy remains in the system (some gets lost by heat, sound, friction, etc). Only the conservation of momentum (and not the conservation of energy) can be applied to this type of collision.

<Align type="center">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$m_1v_{1,i} + m_2v_{2,i} = m_1v_{1,f} + m_2v_{2,f}$$

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,i}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,i}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,f}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,f}^2 + E_{lost}$$

</Align>

- **Perfect inelastic collision** refers to a collision where the two objects stick to each other, and kinetic energy is lost in the process. Only the conservation of momentum (and not the conservation of energy) can be applied to this type of collision.

<Align type="center">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$m_1v_{1,i} + m_2v_{2,i} = (m_1 + m_2)v_{1~and~2,f}$$

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1,i}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2,i}^2 = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_{1~and~2,f}^2 + E_{lost}$$

## Centre of Mass

The **centre of mass** of a group of constituents is a position where one can assume that all the masses are concentrated at that point. This concept was derived for one to solve problems more easily.

If a system is closed, then that system's centre of mass remains the same.

<Rule
  statement={
    <Math
      math="x_{centre~of~mass} = \frac{\sum_i m_i x_i}{\sum_i m_i}"
      type="block"
    />
  }
  terms={[
    {
      term: 'x_{centre~of~mass}',
      annotation: <span>Centre of mass</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'm_i',
      annotation: <span>Mass of the i-th constituent</span>,
    },
    {
      term: 'x_i',
      annotation: <span>Position of the i-th constituent</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>
