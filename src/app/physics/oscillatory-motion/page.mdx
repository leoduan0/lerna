# Oscillatory Motion

**Oscillatory motion** is the study of oscillating objects.

## Simple Harmonic Motion

**Simple harmonic motion** is a type of motion that has the following characteristics:

- The motion is repetitive and periodic (repeats itself over regular intervals).
- The period, amplitude, and total energy are constant.
- The period is independent of the amplitude.
- The **equilibrium position** is where the net force acting on the system is zero. It is the position where the system naturally tends to return after being displaced.

## Period

The **period** is the time required for one complete oscillation.
