# Properties

In physics, **properties** are aspects of a physical entity.

## Units

Physical properties (_e.g._ mass) are represented using a magnitude (a number) and a **unit**.

**The International System of Units**, or **SI Units**, provides a standard for the units for certain properties.

### The SI Units

| Mass                      | Kilogram | $$ kg $$  |
| Electric Current          | Ampere   | $$ A $$   |
