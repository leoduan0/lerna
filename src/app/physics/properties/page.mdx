# Properties

In physics, **properties** are aspects of a physical entity.

## Units

Physical properties (_e.g._ mass) must be represented with a magnitude (a number) and a **unit**. **The International System of Units**, or **SI Units**, provides a standard for the units for some properties.

### The SI Units

| Quantity                  | Unit     | Symbol    |
| ------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Time                      | Second   | $$ s $$   |
| Length                    | Meter    | $$ m $$   |
| Mass                      | Kilogram | $$ kg $$  |
| Electric Current          | Ampere   | $$ A $$   |
| Thermodynamic Temperature | Kelvin   | $$ K $$   |
| Amount of Substance       | Mole     | $$ mol $$ |
| Luminous Intensity        | Candela  | $$ cd $$  |
