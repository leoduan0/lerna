# Sociocultural Approach

## The Individual and the Group

**Conformity** is a change of behavior as a result of real or imagined group pressure or norms. Conformity is the result of one of our most basic human behaviors: social.

**Comparison** is our tendency to compare ourselves to others around us in order to validate our own behavior and opinions.

Conformity appears to be the result of two key factors:

- Informational social influence: The need for certainty. When we are in ambiguous situations, we engage in social comparison in order to figure out how to behave.

- Normative social influence: The need for social acceptance and approval. We conform in order to be accepted and to fit in.

**Cognitive dissonance** is an extremely uncomfortable feeling when one's behavior or some event does not match one's beliefs.

## Social Identity Theory

We behave based on our in-groups and out-groups.

Social identity is an individual's sense of self that comes from social group membership. In other words, it is an individual-based perception of what defines the “us” from any group membership.

Tajfel & Turner felt behavior could be explained by an individual's group membership.

They outlined four key components that relate to this:

- Social categorization

- Social identification

- Social comparison

- Positive distinctiveness

### Social Categorization

The process by which we identify the groups we belong to and the groups we do not belong to.

- Groups we belong to are our “in-groups” (us)

- Groups we do not belong to are our “out-groups” (them)

### Social Identification

Social identification takes place after deciding to belong to the group.

- This is the process of adopting the norms of the group and taking on the characteristics of the group.

### Social Comparison

After identifying one's in-group, individuals then engage in “social comparison” which is a means of justifying their group membership.

### Positive Distinctiveness

We week higher self-esteem by positively comparing our in-group to an out-group to achieve positive distinctiveness. We favor the traits of our in-group.

## Social Cognitive Theory

### Background

Developed mainly by Albert Bandura - was first called “social learning theory”

Suggests that behavior is learned from the environment through process...

### Modeling

Learning through the observation of other people, which may lead to...

### Conditions

- Attention

- Retention

- Motivation

- Potential

### Vicarious reinforcement

### Factors

- The model stands out in contrast to other models

- The model's behavior must be consistent

- The model is liked and respected by the observer

- The observer perceives a similarity between themselves and the model member of in-group)

- The model's behavior is reinforced
